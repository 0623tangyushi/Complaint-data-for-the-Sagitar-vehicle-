Based on the functional correlation of vehicle systems and the similarity of failure modes, this study categorizes the complaint topics into three groups. Group A includes Topics 1 to 3, constituting the vehicle's core powertrain system, where failures typically manifest as abnormal power output or transmission interruption. Group B covers Topics 4 to 6, representing the chassis and driving control systems; defects in this group directly affect the vehicle's handling stability and braking safety. Group C comprises Topics 7 and 8, involving vehicle structure and functional components, which collectively impact ride comfort, durability, and functional integrity.
